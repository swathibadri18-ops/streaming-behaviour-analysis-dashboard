🎧 **Data in Decibels — Spotify Listening Behavior Analysis**

A personal **data analytics project** built using **Spotify Extended Streaming History** and **Power BI**, focused on understanding **listening habits, engagement patterns, and behavior over time**.

Instead of analyzing *what* music is played, this project explores **how, when, and how deeply** music is consumed using behavioral metrics like **listening time, skip rate, and repeat engagement**.

---

🚀 **Features**

* 📈 **Listening Trend Analysis** – Track listening behavior over time using time-series analysis.
* 🎵 **Top Artists & Tracks** – Identify artists and tracks with the highest listening time.
* ⏰ **Time & Habit Insights** – Analyze listening behavior by hour, weekday vs weekend.
* ⏭️ **Skip Behavior Analysis** – Use skip rate as a proxy for engagement and attention.
* 📊 **Year-wise Track Comparison** – Discover which tracks persist across multiple years.
* 🎨 **Dark-Themed Dashboards** – Clean, stakeholder-friendly Power BI visualizations.

📊 **Dashboards Overview**

### 🟣 Dashboard 1: Overview

* Listening trend over time
* KPI cards (Total Minutes, Unique Artists, Total Tracks, Skip Rate)
* Top artists by listening time

### 🟣 Dashboard 2: Time & Habit Analysis

* Listening by hour
* Weekday vs weekend comparison
* Top played tracks by year
* Skip rate by hour

---

🧩 **Key Insights**

* Late-night listening shows **higher engagement and lower skip rates**
* Daytime listening is more fragmented with higher skipping
* A small group of artists dominate listening sessions
* Tracks that persist across years indicate **true engagement**, not just popularity
