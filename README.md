Data in Decibels: Streaming Behavior Analysis
Project Overview

Data in Decibels is a personal data analytics project that analyzes music streaming behavior using Spotify listening history.
The goal of this project is to move beyond surface-level music preferences and understand listening behavior, engagement, and habits through data.

The analysis focuses on when, how, and how deeply music is consumed, using behavioral metrics such as listening time, skip rate, and track recurrence.

**Data Source**

Spotify Extended Streaming History

Data includes:

Track and artist metadata

Listening timestamps

Play duration

Skip behavior

Platform and temporal context

All data used is personal and anonymized where applicable.

**Tools & Technologies
**
Python (data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering)

Power BI (data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard design)

Pandas (data manipulation)

GitHub (version control and project documentation)

**Dashboard Structure**
**Dashboard 1: Overview**

Focuses on high-level listening trends and scale.

Total listening minutes

Unique artists

Total tracks played

Overall skip rate

Listening trend over time

Top artists by listening time

Purpose: Establish context and overall listening behavior.

**Dashboard 2: Time & Habit Analysis**

Focuses on behavioral patterns and engagement quality.

Listening by hour

Weekday vs weekend comparison

Top played tracks by year

Skip rate by hour

Purpose: Understand how time and context influence engagement.

**Key Insights**

Listening behavior varies significantly by time of day, with deeper engagement during late-night hours.

A small subset of artists dominates listening sessions, indicating strong loyalty patterns.

Tracks ranked by listening time provide better insight into engagement than play counts alone.

Skip rate serves as a strong proxy for attention and intent.

Project Highlights

Behavioral analytics over preference-based analysis

Metric design focused on engagement quality

Clean, stakeholder-friendly dashboard layout

Intentional limitation to two dashboards to avoid overengineering

**Use Cases**

Portfolio project for data analyst roles

Demonstration of Power BI dashboarding and DAX skills

Example of turning personal event data into behavioral insights
